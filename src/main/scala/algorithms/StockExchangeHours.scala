/**
 * Given a list of operation hours for each stock exchange, validate if the customer can send a trading order during the input hour.

The interviewer asked me to list all possible solutions that I got and explain the time and space complexity of each solution. Also, he asked me to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

```
// Example
Operation hours
09:00-16:00 Royal Bank of Scotland
11:00-17:00 Morgan Stanley

Test case #1 - expected result: SUCCESS
10:00-17:00

Test case #2 - expected result: FAILURE
15:00-21:00
```
